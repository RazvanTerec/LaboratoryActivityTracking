# LaboratoryActivityTracking

The application is a Web Application for tracking the laboratory activity for the Software Design laboratory. The application has two types of users (student and teacher) which provide a username and a password to use the application.

The teacher can perform the following operations:
  - Login
  - CRUD on students. For each student we should track: email address, full name, group
    (ex. 30434) and hobby – free field.
  - Can add/edit/delete Laboratory classes (Subjects of lab classes- eg. Software design,
    Maths) is out of scope). For each class we should track: Laboratory number (#1-#14),
    date, title, objectives (string) and a long description with the laboratory text.
  - CRUD on assignments. Some of the laboratory will have assignments: for each
    assignment we must track the name, deadline, and a long description with the assignment
    text.
  - Grade the submitted assignments individually.
  - Calculate the final grade as an average of all marks. Also store if a student has passed or
    failed the exam by the following rules:
      Passed: - all assignments submitted; grades > 5, average > 6.
      Failed: - condition from passed is not satisfied

The student can perform the following operations:
  - Login with the username and password.
  - View a list of laboratory classes.
  - View the assignments for a laboratory class.
  - Create an assignment submission. Here, students should be able to insert a link to a git
    repository and a short comment (optional) for the teacher.
